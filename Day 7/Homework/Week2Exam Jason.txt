# Exam Week 2

## Section 1

What is Swift and how is it unique?
Swift is designed by Apple for Apple products. It is an attempt to make
an easy to use language that makes it easier to make apps.
It is much cleaner than Objective C that came before it.

What is an optional?
An optional is denoted with a question mark at the end of an expression.
It says a value is not required and nil is also valid.
The expression has to either be force unwrapped or coalesced.

What are the different ways we can unwrap an optional and explain each?
The ! Force unwraps the statement, but will crash if the expression is nil.
Coalescing uses ?? And provides an optional value to substitute if nil.

What is optional chaining?
Optional chaining is when multiple function calls all have optional parameters.
You can try to get properties like text on a label that may not exist.

What is MVC? Go into detail and give some of the pros and cons.
Model view controller. The view is separated from the logic. This is good for large
projects that might have different UIs like an android or desktop app.
However, there might be a better method depending on needs, like if 
an app is iOS only.

Explain the Viewcontroller Lifecycle.
The view controller has many functions which will be called over the course of
displaying a view. loadView is the first one called where most of the data setup is done.
There are others like viewDidLoad or viewWillLoad which are called before or after
different parts of the setup. This gives developers plenty of places to hook into
to tweak the display process. There are also teardown methods.

In the Application LifeCycle, what does it mean when the application is Inactive?
The app is currently loaded and probably visible, but something else is taking attention.

What is a closure? What is the difference between an escaping and non-escaping closure?
A closure is the equivalent of a lambda function. It is a short function that is assigned to a 
variable, likely to be executed later. An escaping closure is when a closure gets executed after
the parent function.

What is the difference between reference types and value types?
Reference types are passing a pointer to a function or a variable. This means that both instances
will modify the original value. A value type passes the value on assignment and creates an new
reference. They are both independently modified.

In Swift, how do we pass a value by reference? 
You use the let keyword it uses the same reference, since you can't modify the object.

What are some higher order functions used in swift and what do they do? (Give 2)
High order functions take in a closure with parameters such as sorted and map on an array.


What is Autolayout?
Autolayout defines constraints and relative positions and lets the device determine the details.
This scales up to different sized and shaped screens.
